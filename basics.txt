websockets are two way connection between a client and a server.
websockets a problem of one way connection because server cant initiate request. but there is a way called long polling.
ws and wss like http and https.
socket io is a js library for realtime web app.
server can emit events and client can also emit events.
we can use ajax instead of websockets but multiple requests are waste in checking our db whether a new message is arrived or not.
